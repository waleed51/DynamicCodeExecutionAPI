# DynamicCodeExecutionAPI

A web application that allows users to write and execute multiple C# functions dynamically, multiple source files should be 
persisted in database. The UI should generate input fields based on the selected functionâ€™s parameters and 
display the output after execution, executed function could internally use another function from another source file.
Feel free to add any TODO comments for potential enhancements.
