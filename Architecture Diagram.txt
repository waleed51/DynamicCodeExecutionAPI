Below is a description of the architecture:

Frontend (Angular 17):
 - Communicates with the backend over REST APIs.
 - Displays the list of functions, provides a code editor for writing functions.
Backend (ASP.NET 8):
 - API Layer: Exposes RESTful APIs for CRUD operations on functions and executing code dynamically.
Business Layer: 
 - Handles dynamic code compilation using Roslyn Compiler.
Data Access Layer:
- Interacts with the database to save and retrieve function metadata and source files.
Database:
 - Source files and their content.

Docker:
 - Hosts the Angular frontend, .NET backend, and the database in separate containers.
