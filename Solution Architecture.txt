High-Level Overview
The solution is based on a microservice architecture with the following components:

Frontend (Angular 17):
A dynamic and responsive user interface for writing, selecting, and executing C# functions.
Generates UI elements (input fields) based on the parameters of the selected function.
Backend (ASP.NET 8):
Responsible for securely persisting, compiling, and executing C# code.
Provides APIs for managing source files, functions, and their parameters.
Executes functions dynamically using Roslyn Compiler.
Database:
Stores the source files, function metadata, and execution logs.
Docker:
Hosts the application securely in isolated containers for both the frontend and backend.
Ensures a consistent and portable development/production environment.
